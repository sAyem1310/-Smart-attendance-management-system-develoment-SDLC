A Smart Attendance Management System (SAMS) is a software solution designed to automate the process of recording and tracking attendance for various purposes, such as schools, colleges, businesses, or any organization that requires a systematic way of monitoring attendance. The system typically utilizes technology to simplify and enhance the attendance management process.

Developing a Smart Attendance Management System involves several stages in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here's a simplified overview:


#1.Planning:

 Project Scope: Define the scope of the attendance management system, including features, functionalities, and user requirements.
 Feasibility Study: Assess the technical and financial feasibility of the project.

2.Analysis:

 Requirement Gathering: Collect detailed requirements for the mobile application, including user stories, use cases, and functional  specifications.
 System Design: Create a high-level system architecture and design based on the gathered requirements.

3.Design:

 Detailed Design: Develop detailed design specifications for the mobile app, including user interface design, database design, and system  architecture.
 Prototyping: Create a prototype to visualize the application's look and feel.

4.Implementation:

 Coding: Write the code for the mobile application based on the design specifications.
 Database Development: Implement the database structure and connectivity.
 Integration: Integrate different modules and components.

5.Testing:

 Unit Testing: Test individual components or functions of the application.
 Integration Testing: Test the interaction between integrated components.
 System Testing: Evaluate the complete system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Let users test the application to ensure it meets their needs.

6.Deployment:

Deployment Planning: Develop a plan for deploying the mobile application, including server setup and configuration.
Release: Make the application available to users.

7.Maintenance and Support:

Bug Fixes: Address and fix any issues or bugs identified after deployment.
Updates and Enhancements: Implement updates and add new features based on user feedback and evolving
